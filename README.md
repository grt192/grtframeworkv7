GRT Framework v6
================

GRTFramework is an asynchronous, event-driven framework built on top of [WPILibJ](http://firstforge.wpi.edu/sf/projects/wpilib), which is provided by FIRST and includes a host of useful low-level hardware classes.

The purpose of GRTFramework is:
* To provide a framework for rapid FRC robot development
* An asynchronous design and a focus on quality code design
* Coder happiness :)

Please feel free to email any of the developers if you have questions about the code.
